# Urban Coyotes Sightings in Montreal

## Overview
This project aims to explore the distribution of coyote sightings in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from 2017 to 2023 while focusing on the years 2017, 2019, 2021, 2023. This project uses publicly available data on coyote sightings provided by the City of Montreal [Source](https://donnees.montreal.ca/dataset/signalements-de-coyotes), parks and greenspaces [Source](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/2e9e4d2f-173a-4c3d-a5e3-565d79baa27d), and municipal boundaries [Source](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/00bd85eb-23aa-4669-8f1b-ba9a000e3dd8) provided by the Government of Canada 
The goal of this analysis is to determine the effectiveness of the City of Montreal's hazing program in reducing the number of coyote sightings in the city.

## Methodology
The project uses Python and geospatial data analysis packages such as GeoPandas, Matplotlib. The data is taken directly from the source and the code will show how it was cleaned and processed to create a geodataframe, which is used to plot the spatial distribution of coyote sightings across Montreal. Following, the plots are then analyzed to decipher any patterns or trends.

**Final Remarks**
- Use the data sources linked above for the optimal experience of this project
- Enure that Python, Geopandas, Matplotlib are installed
- Since this is data based on sightings, it is assumed that these sightings are accurate and legitimate 
- ONLY RUN THE CELLS THAT MAKE THE GDF AND THE PLOTS
- NO NEED TO RUN THE CELLS THAT GIVE THE BOROUGH INFORMATION IN TABLE
- If any issues with running the code or any questions in general feel free to conctact me: mtlwildlifemanagement@gmail.com
